sfMaker
=======

The open source version of the SFMaker application &amp; library for creating sound effects

A live demo of the latest (non open source) version of SFMaker can be found here:
   [http://www.leshylabs.com/apps/sfMaker/](http://www.leshylabs.com/apps/sfMaker/)

NOTE: The most recent version of SFMaker is not yet available in an
open source form.  There is a much older open source version out
there.  Because of possible interest I have included WaveFile.js here.
Eventually I'll push the rest of SFMaker out.  This currently is
available under an LGPL license, but a future release may change that
to something more permissive.
